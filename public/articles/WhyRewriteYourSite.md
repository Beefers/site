# Why rewrite your site 5 times?

## What?

If you're not aware, the site you are currently viewing is the 6th iteration - each time being a full rewrite! Almost every version used an ever so slightly different framework, too!

## History

### Legacy or Version 0

The "legacy" version of the site was written in pure HTML, CSS and JS, and was my first webdev adventure. It is not hosted anywhere anymore. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Beefers/site/tree/legacy).

### First commit on Vercel + Version 1

The first commit ever hosted on Vercel was [this](https://rem-my-github-io-kp5pssc3h-rem-my.vercel.app/). It was back when my online name was `rem`! It was part of the first rewrite - from HTML to Svelte and SvelteKit. As you can see, it's quite basic, as it was a near-direct migration from Legacy.

Version 1 remained relatively similar to the first commit throughout it's lifespan. Here is it's [final commit](https://site-git-v1-beefers.vercel.app/).

### Version 2

Version 2 was where I started to explore the innards of styling with CSS. This version was also written with Svelte and SvelteKit, and styled using the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) colour scheme. Here is the [first working commit](https://site-9zgoiir3s-rem-my.vercel.app/) and [last commit](https://site-git-v2-beefers.vercel.app/). Between this time, I migrated back to using `Beef` as my online name. I still regret switching to `rem` - it was a decision on impulse.

### Version 3

Version 3 was an interesting case. It lasted 6 commits, 4 of them adding meaningful content and some of the others outright not working on Vercel. The first commit did not work and the last commit simply edited the README. I encountered a few annoyances using Astro and Svelte together - for example, fonts were not loading properly. This, and a general lack of motivation, drove v3 to death - it never had a production deployment, as far as I can remember!
Here is the [first working commit](https://site-jlflzgxce-beefers.vercel.app/) and the [last commit](https://site-git-v3-beefers.vercel.app/).

### Version 4

At the time of writing, v4 is the current Production build. It is when I started to take webdev quite seriously - I felt the need for a real portfolio. Unfortunately, v4 never really quite met this aspect - forever remaining with placeholder text on the front page. I am still very proud of it, being written using SolidJS, styled with WindiCSS and bundled with Vite.
The first 2 commits (totalling 4 deployments) did not work. As always, here is the [first working commit](https://site-jh5zqygpw-beefers.vercel.app/) and the [latest commit](https://site-git-v4-beefers.vercel.app/).

### Version 5 aka the `master` branch

The version you are currently looking at! Feast your eyes upon it's beauty - I'm kidding, of course. Once again, I'm very proud of this version. It is built using a similar tech stack to v4, with a minor alteration - it uses TypeScript! I have also made sure that it is maintainable. Hopefully, it never makes me want to fully rewrite it, but no promises. Here is the [first commit](https://site-avz3yew0y-beefers.vercel.app/), the [first restyling commit](https://site-8hxubuf83-beefers.vercel.app/), the [second restyling commit](https://site-ju02v5g2r-beefers.vercel.app/) (which brought it close to what it is today) and the [latest commit](https://site-git-master-beefers.vercel.app/).
